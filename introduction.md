# Introducing R

## An awesome way to do data analysis!

# Why is R awesome?

Welcome to [R](http://www.r-project.org/)!  If you're here, you've probably heard that R is wonderful data analysis tool, but you may be wondering what R is, exactly.

R is a freely-available, open-source, derivative of [S-Plus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-PLUS) and has attracted the attention of wide range of users in both the academic and private sectors.  There are several features which make R appealing as a data analysis environment.  

First, it is entirely open source.  This means that the software is both free to obtain (free as in pizza) and that the implementation details of all statistical methods found in R are freely available and open to scrutiny (free as in ideas).  

Second, R has emerged as one of the most accommodating environments for statistical research, leading to the establishment of an active and innovative community.  The library of statistical methods implemented in R is enormous!  No closed-source commerical software (SPSS, Minitab, etc.) even comes close.

Finally, R implements a full-featured [programming language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_Project) which can be used to abstract and automate sophisticated analysis procedures.  In this class you'll be learning to program in R.  It will be awesome.

However, the major disadvantage to R is that it has a significantly steeper learning curve than spreadsheets or commercial stats packages.  Unlike these other types of software, R doesn't offer much in the way of a graphical interface - you type commands at a prompt to make it do your bidding.  If you haven't ever worked in a command line environment it can definitely take some getting used to!  There is one huge advantage to this setup, however:  once you figure out how to do an analysis once, you can save your commands to a text file (".R" script) and re-run them on any new data you generate.  This allows you to avoid repetitive tasks and ensures that each time you analyze your data you are performing the analysis in the same way.

Let's do some computing!  How do you think you could get R to add two numbers together for you?
