# Lab:  Clustering and Network Analysis

In today's lab we will be exploring tools designed to help us make sense of very large biological datasets by using machine learning techniques to identify patterns or correlations in the underlying data.


#  Cytoscape

One of the most well developed network analysis tools currently being used in systems biology is the Cytoscape package.  You can find the Cytoscape [home page here](http://www.cytoscape.org).  

Cytoscape should be installed on both the Biology computer lab workstations and on the Science stable image.  If it isn't you can either download a platform-specific installer or, if you are working at a computer where you don't have permission to install new software, you can download the "Arhive Distribution" files which will have executable .jar (Java) files.

To begin today's lab, work through the Introductory Cytoscape tutorials
